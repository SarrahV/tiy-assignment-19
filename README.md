# Backbone models
Create a Backbone model called Employee, Use it with the included data.json to build an employee grid.  

The grid needs to have column headings for every property. The column headings must be dynamic,   
meaning you must programmatically determine the headings of the grid based on the data once it is loaded.  

Note the data is a JSON array, not an object, so you will need to load it using a regular Ajax request.   
Once you get the data you will need to iterate over it to create a model for each object.

Once you have an array of employee models, use them to create the grid. The grid can be any markup you   
want to use including a table, list items, divs, or definition lists.

Try to make the grid attractive.
